 Rainfall-Temperature-Yield-Humidity-Analysis
 Agriculture Data Analytics – AWS S3 + Snowflake + Power BI    End-to-end agriculture data analytics project using AWS S3, Snowflake, and Power BI to analyze rainfall, temperature, humidity, and yield trends for data-driven farming insights.

#  Agriculture Data Analytics – AWS S3 + Snowflake + Power BI  

##  Project Overview  
This project delivers an end-to-end agriculture data analytics solution by integrating AWS S3, Snowflake, and Power BI.  
It transforms raw agricultural datasets into actionable insights across rainfall, temperature, yield, and humidity trends — helping stakeholders understand how environmental factors impact crop performance.  

---

##  Problem Statement  
Agricultural datasets are often scattered, unstructured, and complex.  
Without proper analysis, it becomes challenging to:  
- Track the impact of rainfall, temperature, and humidity on crop yield  
- Compare seasonal and regional variations  
- Build data-driven strategies for sustainable farming  

---

##  Solution  
This project provides a modern data pipeline and visual analytics framework:  
-  Data Ingestion → Raw data stored in AWS S3  
-  Data Warehousing → Processed and structured in Snowflake  
-  Visualization → Interactive dashboards built in Power BI  

This approach ensures scalable, accurate, and user-friendly agricultural insights.

##  Dashboards & Insights  

### 1️ Rainfall Analysis  
- Rainfall by Year & Season → Detects long-term climate patterns.  
- Rainfall vs Crop Yield → Highlights dependency of crops on rainfall.  
- Regional Rainfall Trends → Identifies rainfall variations across locations.  

### 2️ Temperature Analysis  
- Seasonal Temperature Distribution → Measures heat variations across planting seasons.  
- Temperature vs Crop Type → Reveals how crops respond to temperature changes.  
- Geographic Heat Patterns → Regional breakdown of temperature trends.  

### 3️ Yield Analysis  
- Crop Yield by Season → Shows seasonal productivity differences.  
- Yield by Location → Regional performance mapping for agriculture planning.  
- Crop-wise Yield Trends → Identifies top and low-performing crops.  

### 4️ Humidity Analysis  
- Humidity Variation by Year → Tracks long-term moisture trends.  
- Humidity Impact on Crops → Analyzes crop sensitivity to humidity.  
- Regional Humidity Levels → Compares geographic differences in moisture conditions.
